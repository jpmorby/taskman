## Introduction

Rudimentary first pass at a todo list in livewire 3.6, Tailwind v4 and FluxUI .. mainly as an exercise to try and do CRUD things with livewire / writing an SPA / etc

### FluxUI 2.x

Using as many FluxUI features as I can to simplify design (as I'm lousy at design)

#### Features

- Per user task lists
- Sortable and filterable
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd-A add, Cmd-K search)

##### TO DO

- Categories
- Backups / Export functionality (JSON?)
- Maybe add Sentry and put a version live on task.me.uk
- Reverb for notifications (backup jobs / etc)
- Add file attachment so you can add docs to the tasks
